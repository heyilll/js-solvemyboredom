# js-solvemyboredom

## Description

This is an interactive frontend web application for discovering something to do and how to do it. Boredom is a common dilema, that most adults and children experience regularly. This web application will allow users to solve their boredom by using the cleverly designed search engine, which utilises 3 APIs, to find activity ideas. They will then be able to use the YouTube videos and AI responses displayed to help them learn a new skill, have fun and potentially meet new people along the way.  

## User Story 

AS someone who is bored

I WANT to find an activity or skill I can do or learn

SO THAT I am not bored


## Acceptance Criteria

- Create a webpage that contains an input field that allows a user to:
  - search for activities by the number of participants
  - search for activities by type of activity
  - search for a random activity
- The webpage will display an activity following the user input.
- Activities searched for will be saved to local storage when the save button is clicked.
- Previously searched for activities will persit on the webpage between refreshes of the page allowing users to   re-select activities.
- At least two APIs will be used to create the application. 
- The application will be responsive. 

## Deployment 

The webpage can be accessed here: https://heyilll.github.io/js-solvemyboredom/

Upon opening the webpage, the user can use the search panel to search for an activity by type &/or the number of participants, or they can select a random activity. The application will then take them to a new webpage where the activity that is generated will be detailed and a YouTube Video displayed, along with an AI generated response for how to undertake the chosen activity. Users can return to the homepage where previously chosen activities are stored for selection again.
